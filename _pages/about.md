I'm Sakina Shibuya (渋谷　沙紀奈). I'm currently a consultant at [University of Tokyo Economic Consulting (UTEcon)](https://utecon.net/en/).

I completed my Ph.D. degree in Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2025. 
My research interest is development economics and applied microeconomics with a special focus on gender differences in the economy. 

Much of my recent work is based in Colombia and Pakistan, where I study how formal and informal institutions shape economic outcomes, especially for women.
