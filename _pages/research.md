**When Protection Fails: Effects of Military Bases on Sexual Violence in Colombia** (with [Felipe Parra](https://ffparra303.github.io/)) [Download](https://sakinashibuya.github.io/files/JMP_SakinaShibuya.pdf) \
Presented at: _West Point Social Science Seminar 2025, NEUDC 2024, SEA 2024, Empirical Studies of Conflict (ESOC) 2024, PacDev 2024, SITE 2024_.

Sexual violence committed by soldiers is ubiquitous across the world. This paper investigates
the impact of military base presence on sexual violence, fertility, and child
support disputes in Colombia, a nation with a recent experience of large-scale growth
in military base presence. Using a dataset constructed from diverse sources, we track
military base locations across Colombian municipalities from 1998 to 2016. Employing
an event-study approach, we identify the causal effects of military bases on host communities.
Our findings reveal that the presence of military bases significantly increases
sexual violence, with a 72% rise in registered cases over the course of 15 years after
the introduction of a military base. Despite this increase in sexual violence, we find no
significant changes in fertility or child support disputes. These results are not driven
by changes in population or security conditions. This study advances the literature on
conflict-related sexual violence and the broader consequences of military base presence
on local populations.

**Willing but Unable: Social Norms and Costs of Hiring Women in Pakistan** (with [Zunia Tirmazee](https://sites.google.com/view/zuniasaiftirmazee) and Hana Zahir)
[Download](https://sakinashibuya.github.io/files/WillingButUnable_SakinaShibuya.pdf)

Despite 74% of employers in the garment manufacturing industry in Punjab, Pakistan believing women are as capable as men at on-site production jobs, few hire women on factory floors. While much research has been conducted into the constraints women face in obtaining out-of-home employment, this paper instead investigates: What deters firms from hiring women? We use unique firm and worker survey data, complemented by behavioral experiments to measure willingness to comply with gender norms and estimate the impact of economic costs on hiring decisions. We find that top managers exhibit low willingness to comply with segregation norms and do not expect resistance from male workers. However, economic costs, particularly those related to providing safe transportation, significantly constrain female hiring, reducing the likelihood by 15%. These findings indicate that reducing economic burdens, such as transportation costs, could effectively increase female employment, highlighting the need for targeted policy interventions.
			

**Watch Your Step:The Economic and Behavioral Responses of Rural Households to Landmines during Conflict** (with [Felipe Parra](https://ffparra303.github.io/)) [Download](https://ffparra303.github.io/papers/JMP_FelipeParra.pdf) \
Presented at: _APPAM 2024, SEA 2024_.

Antipersonnel landmines, though intended to target combatants, disproportionately impact civilians, disrupting economic activity and altering household decision-making processes. This paper examines how rural households in Colombia adjust their labor market decisions and healthcare-seeking behavior in response to recent and nearby landmine events, using detailed spatial data on landmine events combined with longitudinal household survey data. Our findings show that individuals engage less in risky labor activities following recent landmine events, but these responses are heavily influenced by liquidity constraints. Specifically, liquidity-unconstrained individuals are 28\% less likely to work in occupations other than agricultural day labor, particularly in agriculture, and 12\% less likely to spend time on agricultural tasks in their own fields. These households hire additional agricultural workers after landmine exposure, substituting external labor for their own. In contrast, liquidity-constrained individuals are 45\% more likely to engage in agricultural day labor to compensate for income losses stemming from reduced non-agricultural employment. Moreover, landmine events deter both adults and children from seeking formal preventative medical care. This study highlights the differences in responses between liquidity-constrained and unconstrained individuals to shifts in perceived security during conflict.


**The Effects of Internally Displaced Peoples on Consumption and Inequality in Mali** (with Jeremy Foltz) \
_Revise and Resubmit at the Journal of African Economies_

A series of civil conflicts in Mali has generated more than 346,000 internally displaced people (UNHCR,2020).
This study estimates the effect of conflict-generated internal displacement on consumption, poverty, and inequality
in host communities. Using comprehensive nationwide household survey data this study finds that wealth at the
commune and household level is non-decreasing in internally displaced people (IDP) hosting communes relative
to non-IDP host communes. We also find some partial evidence of increasing consumption at the household level
although inequality and poverty at the commune level remain the same. The evidence suggests a fairly successful
hosting and aid process inMali for IDP in terms of mitigating economic disruption for host communities.
