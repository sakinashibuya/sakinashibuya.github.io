**Effects of Military Bases on Women in Rural Colombia** (with Felipe Parra) 

Presented at: PacDev 2024, SITE 2024 \\

This paper investigates the impact of military base presence on women in Colombia during the country's significant military expansion from 2000 to 2016. Using a novel dataset constructed from newspaper articles, we exploit temporal and geographical variations in base openings and closures to causally estimate the effects on fertility, sexual violence, and education. We find that, while overall fertility is unaffected, single mothers experience a 6-40\% increase in fertility. We also find evidence of higher sexual violence incidence near bases, as well as of increased cases of child support disputes with low-paid drafted soldiers. Despite concerns about the educational outcomes of young single mothers, we do not find strong negative effects on female school enrollment or attainment. This study contributes to the literature by providing a causal analysis of the multifaceted impacts of military base presence on women in host communities, highlighting the complex relationship between armed forces and local populations in conflict-affected regions.

**Understanding Constraints in Hiring Women in Pakistan** (with Zunia Tirmazee)
74\% of the employers in our survey think women are at least as good as, if not better than, men at on-site production jobs in the 
garment manufacturing industry in Pakistan. Yet, most factories still do not hire many women on factory floors. 
While much research has been conducted into the constraints women face in obtaining out-of-home employment, this paper instead investigates: 
What deters firms from hiring women? We utilized unique firm survey data, complemented by a hypothetical-choice methodology and a behavioral game, 
to examine the economic and non-economic costs of hiring women. Our study innovatively observes how monetary incentives can influence compliance 
with social norms related to gender segregation. Preliminary results suggest that the willingness to comply with these norms are not as relevant 
as expected, and costs of hiring women, especially the cost of providing safe transportation to women may be more salient to firms' decision 
to hire women. 

**Effects of Landmines on Rural Householdsâ€™ Behaviors in Colombia** (with Felipe Parra)
Despite targeting combatants, antipersonnel landmines disproportionately harm civilians, obstructing Colombian rural households' 
economic activities. We analyze how these households adjust their labor decisions based on proximity to landmine events. 
Using detailed data on landmine locations and longitudinal household data, we find that nearby landmines initially restrict mobility, reducing participation in non-daily agricultural jobs outside the household's farms and work hours. However, a partial recovery is observed within 1-3 years. This restriction on mobility is also observed in other activities conducted outside the household's farms such as visits to professional medical services. Additionally, exposed households increase demand for agricultural labor, suggesting a demand-side impact. This study improves understanding of landmines' nuanced socioeconomic effects, informing policies to mitigate harm and maximize recovery.
