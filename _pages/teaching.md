**Introduction to Statistical Methods for Public Policy Analysis, Fall 2021** 
I served as a solo TA for a graduate-level applied statistics course at the La Follette School of Public Affairs. 
This is a required course for public policy master's students. The class consisted of about 50 students with diverse math and statistics background. My responsibilities included leading discussion sessions and hosting office hours to supplement the main instructor's lectures. I developed the material for all discussion session during the semester.

Non-Academic Teaching Experience
=====
I have extensive non-academic teaching experience, leading training sessions on statistical coding and data visualization for faculty, 
government officials, and development practitioners. These experiences have broadened my teaching portfolio and enhanced my ability to teach complex concepts 
to non-specialist audiences.

	+ Statistical coding and GitHub training for faculty members at the Lahore School of Economics (2022)
	+ Summer school on program evaluation and statistical coding for university students and development practitioners in Rwanda (2018)
	+ Short courses on statistical coding and data visualization for Rwandese government officials (2018)
	+ R and Stata coding training sessions at the Development Impact (DIME) group at the World Bank (2017-2019)
	+ Enumerator training for agricultural household surveys in Rwanda for DIME (2017, 2018)
