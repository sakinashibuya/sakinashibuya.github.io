** Introduction to Statistical Methods for Public Policy Analysis, Fall 2021** 
I served as a solo TA for a graduate-level applied statistics course at the La Follette School of Public Affairs. 
This is a required course for public policy master's students. The class consisted of about 50 students with diverse math and statistics background. My responsibilities included leading discussion sessions and hosting office hours to supplement the main instructor's lectures. I developed the material for all discussion session during the semester. Click [here](https://sakinashibuya.github.io/files/PA818_Fall2021_Evaluations.pdf) for the teaching evaluation.
